Proposal:  
  Our project propostal is to create a backend API for a recipe sharing blog that will  
  allow users to log what they cook: kind of like a Facebook for recipes. Users can access their own  
  diary of recipies as well as look through others posted recipes.   
  There would also be a system to leave ratings and comments on any   
  recipes they view in their feed. Searching through recipes would include being  
  able to filter through the recipes by type (e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert), time needed, level (e.g. beginner-friendly), dietary restrictions, etc.
